My name is Simon Corcoran, and this is my mission as an IELTS
teacher: I aim to provide the best information about the IELTS
test, from an ex-examiner’s perspective. Having been an examiner,
I know exactly what IELTS examiners want, and my advice is correct
and reliable. There’s a lot of bad information about IELTS on the
Internet, so it makes sense for you to check with an ex-examiner.
I create materials for self-study. I work alone, so I can’t offer
face-to-face lessons or a full ‘language school’ service. My
materials can be used by people who are studying alone, or by
people who already attend a language school or IELTS course.
Many IELTS teachers use my materials with their students too.
Whatever your situation, I believe you’ll find my resources useful.
